# OKR Demo UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for OKR Demo's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Introduction

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

1. **Team Lead/Manager:** Professionals responsible for setting and tracking team objectives. Need quick visibility into team progress, ability to align individual OKRs with company goals, and efficient check-in workflows.

2. **Individual Contributor:** Team members who own specific key results. Prioritize ease of updating progress, clarity on what's expected, and understanding how their work contributes to larger goals.

3. **Executive/C-Suite:** Leadership needing high-level dashboards showing organizational alignment, progress trends, and potential risks. Value data visualization and strategic insights over operational details.

#### Usability Goals

- **Rapid onboarding:** New users can create their first OKR within 3 minutes
- **Effortless updates:** Users can update progress in under 30 seconds via async check-ins
- **Clear hierarchy:** Visual representation makes goal alignment immediately obvious
- **Mobile-friendly:** Core tasks (viewing progress, quick updates) work seamlessly on mobile
- **Cognitive ease:** Interface feels lightweight, not overwhelming like traditional PM tools

#### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear communication over aesthetic innovation. OKRs are about transparency.
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Show summary views by default, detailed breakdowns on demand. Avoid information overload.
3. **Rhythm over rigidity** - Design for weekly check-in cadences with gentle nudges, not strict enforcement.
4. **Visual hierarchy first** - Use color, size, and layout to communicate goal importance and progress at a glance.
5. **Speed is a feature** - Every interaction should feel snappy. Minimize clicks, maximize clarity.

    A --> F[Settings]
    F --> F1[Profile]
    F --> F2[Notifications]
    F --> F3[Integrations]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Tab-based navigation at top level with 4 main sections:
- Dashboard (home/overview)
- OKRs (with context switcher for My/Team/Company)
- Check-ins (async update workflow)
- Settings (profile, preferences, integrations)

**Secondary Navigation:**
- Context switcher within OKR section (My/Team/Company toggle)
- Time period selector (Current Cycle / Past Cycles)
- Quick action floating button for "New OKR" and "Quick Update"

**Breadcrumb Strategy:**
- Minimal breadcrumbs since depth is shallow (max 2-3 levels)
- Breadcrumbs show hierarchy only when drilling into Team Member details or specific OKR details
- Format: Dashboard > Team OKRs > John Doe > Q1 2025

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Create New OKR

**User Goal:** Create and publish a new Objective with associated Key Results

**Entry Points:**
- Dashboard "Quick Action" button
- OKRs page "Create New OKR" button
- Empty state prompts for first-time users

**Success Criteria:** OKR is created, aligned to parent objective (if applicable), and visible to relevant team members

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[User clicks Create OKR] --> Step1[Select OKR Level]
    Step1 --> |Personal| Step2a[Enter Objective]
    Step1 --> |Team| Step2a
    Step1 --> |Company| Step2a

    Step2a --> Step3[Add Key Results]
    Step3 --> Step4{Add Another KR?}
    Step4 --> |Yes| Step3
    Step4 --> |No| Step5[Select Time Period]

    Step5 --> Step6{Align to Parent?}
    Step6 --> |Yes| Step7[Choose Parent Objective]
    Step6 --> |No| Step8[Preview OKR]
    Step7 --> Step8

    Step8 --> Step9{Confirm?}
    Step9 --> |Edit| Step2a
    Step9 --> |Publish| Success[OKR Created & Published]

    Step1 --> |Cancel| Cancel[Return to Previous Screen]
    Step8 --> |Cancel| Cancel
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- User tries to create KR without measurable metric → Show inline validation requiring unit/target
- User attempts to align to own objective → Prevent circular dependency with error message
- Network failure during save → Auto-save draft locally, show retry banner
- User abandons mid-flow → Prompt to save as draft before exiting
- Duplicate objective detected → Suggest existing OKR, offer to proceed anyway

**Notes:** Consider wizard-style multi-step form for first-time users, single-page form for power users (togglable preference)

### Flow 2: Weekly Check-in Update

**User Goal:** Quickly update progress on key results as part of weekly rhythm

**Entry Points:**
- Weekly reminder notification (push/email)
- Check-ins tab
- Inline update from Dashboard or OKRs view

**Success Criteria:** Progress percentages updated, optional status comment added, team visibility maintained

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[User initiates check-in] --> Step1[View KRs Requiring Update]
    Step1 --> Step2[Update First KR Progress]

    Step2 --> Step3{Add Status Note?}
    Step3 --> |Yes| Step4[Enter Brief Comment]
    Step3 --> |No| Step5{More KRs?}
    Step4 --> Step5

    Step5 --> |Yes| Step2
    Step5 --> |No| Step6[Review Summary]

    Step6 --> Step7{Confirm?}
    Step7 --> |Edit| Step2
    Step7 --> |Submit| Success[Check-in Recorded]

    Success --> Notify[Notify Relevant Stakeholders]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- Progress decreases significantly → Prompt for explanation before submitting
- User skips KR updates → Allow partial check-in, flag incomplete items
- Multiple updates in same day → Consolidate or show history timeline
- KR already at 100% → Offer to mark as complete, suggest celebration moment
- User behind on check-ins → Show catch-up mode with batch update option

**Notes:** Optimize for mobile speed - large touch targets, minimal typing, smart defaults

### Flow 3: View Team Alignment

**User Goal:** Understand how team/individual OKRs connect to company objectives

**Entry Points:**
- Team OKRs > Alignment View
- Dashboard "Alignment" widget
- Individual OKR detail page "Show Alignment"

**Success Criteria:** User can visualize hierarchical goal connections and identify misalignments

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[User opens Alignment View] --> Step1[Display Company OKRs at Top]
    Step1 --> Step2[Show Department/Team Layer]
    Step2 --> Step3[Show Individual OKRs]

    Step3 --> Action1{User Action}
    Action1 --> |Click OKR| Detail[Show OKR Detail Panel]
    Action1 --> |Filter by Team| Filter[Apply Team Filter]
    Action1 --> |Expand/Collapse| Toggle[Toggle Hierarchy Level]

    Detail --> Back1[Return to Alignment View]
    Filter --> Back1
    Toggle --> Back1

    Back1 --> Action1
    Action1 --> |Exit| End[Return to Previous View]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- Too many OKRs to display → Implement virtual scrolling, collapse by default
- Unaligned OKRs exist → Highlight in warning color, suggest parent objectives
- Circular dependencies → Detect and show error state with resolution suggestions
- User lacks permission to view certain OKRs → Show placeholder with "Restricted" label
- Empty state (no OKRs in cycle) → Show instructional empty state with "Create First OKR" CTA

**Notes:** Consider graph visualization library for complex alignment trees, maintain performance with 50+ OKRs

- Color contrast ratios: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+) and UI components
- Focus indicators: Visible 2px outline with 3:1 contrast against background, never remove focus styles
- Text sizing: Support browser zoom up to 200%, all text remains readable and functional

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible via Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys. Logical tab order follows visual flow
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML (nav, main, article), ARIA labels for icon buttons, live regions for dynamic updates
- Touch targets: Minimum 44×44px for all interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls)

**Content:**
- Alternative text: All informational images, icons, and charts have descriptive alt text or aria-label
- Heading structure: Proper hierarchy (H1→H2→H3), no skipped levels, one H1 per page
- Form labels: Visible labels for all inputs, grouped with fieldset/legend, clear error messages associated with aria-describedby

### Testing Strategy

- Automated testing with axe-core or Lighthouse in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual keyboard navigation testing for all user flows
- Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (Mac/iOS)
- Color contrast verification for all color combinations
- User testing with assistive technology users during beta phase

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones (portrait/landscape) |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Standard desktop monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, external displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:**
- Mobile: Single column, stacked widgets, full-width cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid where appropriate, sidebar collapses to drawer
- Desktop: Multi-column layouts, persistent sidebar navigation
- Wide: Max content width 1280px centered, additional whitespace on sides

**Navigation Changes:**
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with drawer, bottom tab bar for primary nav
- Tablet: Top tab bar, collapsible sidebar for secondary nav
- Desktop/Wide: Persistent top navigation bar with all options visible

**Content Priority:**
- Mobile: Hide "Recent Activity" feed, collapse dashboard widgets, show only essential KR details
- Tablet: Show condensed versions of secondary content
- Desktop/Wide: Full content with all details and optional panels

**Interaction Changes:**
- Mobile: Bottom sheets for modals, swipe gestures for navigation, larger touch targets
- Tablet: Modal overlays, hybrid touch + keyboard support
- Desktop/Wide: Hover states, keyboard shortcuts, mouse-optimized interactions

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

- **Purposeful movement:** Animations guide attention and clarify relationships, not for decoration
- **Snappy timing:** Fast transitions (200-300ms) maintain perception of speed
- **Respect preferences:** Honor prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
- **Consistent easing:** Use standard easing curves (ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits)

### Key Animations

- **Progress bar updates:** Smooth fill animation with ease-out timing (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- **Card hover elevation:** Subtle shadow increase on hover (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Modal/drawer entrance:** Slide + fade in from edge (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Success celebrations:** Confetti or checkmark bounce on 100% completion (Duration: 600ms, Easing: spring)
- **Status badge changes:** Color cross-fade when status updates (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Expand/collapse:** Height transition with content fade (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading states:** Skeleton shimmer animation (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: linear, infinite loop)
- **Page transitions:** Subtle fade between routes (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial page load under 2 seconds on 4G connection
- **Interaction Response:** UI responds to user input within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and scrolling

### Design Strategies

- Use progressive loading: Show skeleton screens while data loads
- Implement virtual scrolling for lists with 50+ items
- Optimize images: Use WebP format with fallbacks, lazy load below-the-fold images
- Minimize layout shifts: Reserve space for dynamic content with placeholders
- Debounce search and filter inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Use optimistic UI updates: Show changes immediately, sync in background
- Implement service worker for offline capability and faster repeat visits

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Review this specification with stakeholders and gather feedback
2. Create detailed mockups in Figma based on wireframe layouts and component specs
3. Set up design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) in design tool and code
4. Begin component library development with accessibility primitives
5. Conduct design critique session with development team for feasibility review
