# Checklist Results Report

### PM Checklist Results

**Checklist Execution Date:** October 2, 2025

#### 1. Goals Clarity
✅ **PASS** - Goals section clearly defines 7 measurable outcomes (5-minute time-to-value, 70% WAU, status-chasing time reduction, <60s check-ins, QBR automation, 8-10 week delivery, 1 pilot completion)

#### 2. Requirements Completeness
✅ **PASS** - 25 Functional Requirements and 18 Non-Functional Requirements cover all features from Project Brief MVP scope. Requirements traceable to Brief sections (CSV import, wizard, dashboard, check-ins, QBR, settings, templates, empty states).

#### 3. UI/UX Specification
✅ **PASS** - UI Design Goals section comprehensively covers UX vision (speed + clarity), interaction paradigms (progressive disclosure, keyboard-first, optimistic UI), 8 core screens, WCAG AA accessibility with specific contrast ratios and colorblind considerations, branding guidelines (typography, spacing, motion), and responsive web platform strategy.

#### 4. Technical Assumptions Documented
✅ **PASS** - Technical Assumptions section specifies monorepo structure, Next.js/React/TypeScript stack, Drizzle/PostgreSQL schema, Vercel hosting, testing approach (unit + integration, manual for UI), and critical architectural decisions (serverless, optimistic UI, print-to-PDF for QBR, single-tenant with multi-tenant prep).

#### 5. Epic Sequencing
✅ **PASS** - 3 epics follow logical progression: (1) Foundation + CSV→OKR (core value: transformation), (2) Check-ins + Dashboard (core value: momentum + visibility), (3) QBR + Settings (core value: automation + admin). Each epic delivers deployable, testable functionality.

#### 6. Story Sizing
✅ **PASS** - 19 stories across 3 epics. Each story scoped for 2-4 hour AI agent execution ("junior developer" heuristic). Vertical slices: Story 1.4 (CSV upload + mapping), Story 2.1 (check-ins page), Story 3.1 (QBR layout). Enablers integrated into value-delivering stories (e.g., Story 1.2 database schema includes seed data).

#### 7. Acceptance Criteria Quality
✅ **PASS** - All stories have 6-12 acceptance criteria defining "done" from functional perspective. Criteria are testable (e.g., "Dashboard loads in <2 seconds on 3G per NFR1", "Check-in save completes in <500ms per NFR2"), unambiguous (specific API routes, UI elements, validation rules), and include NFRs where critical (performance, accessibility, security).

#### 8. Dependency Mapping
✅ **PASS** - Story dependencies implicitly clear via epic sequencing. Epic 1 establishes foundation (auth, schema, import→OKR) before Epic 2 (check-ins require KRs from Epic 1, dashboard requires check-in data). Epic 3 builds on Epics 1-2 (QBR requires check-in history, settings manages entities created in Epic 1). No story depends on work from later epic.

#### 9. Cross-Cutting Concerns
✅ **PASS** - Authentication (Story 1.3) delivered in Epic 1 before feature stories. Performance optimization (Story 3.8) at end but includes verification of NFRs established throughout (dashboard load, check-in save, CSV parsing, QBR generation). Logging, error handling, loading states integrated into individual stories' acceptance criteria (e.g., optimistic UI in Story 2.1, error boundaries in Story 3.8).

#### 10. Alignment with Brief
✅ **PASS** - PRD directly maps to Project Brief:
- Goals section extracts Brief's Business Objectives + User Success Metrics
- Requirements section implements Brief's MVP Scope (Core Features + Out of Scope enforcement)
- UI Design Goals section incorporates Brief's UX goals (fast comprehension, zero-friction updates, good defaults, visual language)
- Technical Assumptions section uses Brief's Technical Considerations verbatim (Next.js, Drizzle, Vercel, etc.)
- Epic structure delivers Brief's 4-step workflow (import→transform→check-in→review)
- All 5 airline S&M templates from Brief included in Story 1.2 seed data and FR17
- Open questions from Brief noted in Settings stories (calendar vs. fiscal quarters, confidence rollup logic, unit edge cases)

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **PRD READY FOR ARCHITECTURE PHASE**

All checklist items pass. PRD provides sufficient detail for UX Expert and Architect to proceed. No blocking gaps identified.

**Recommendations for Next Phase:**
1. UX Expert should create wireframes for wizard steps (drag-to-regroup UI in Story 1.5 needs visual specification)
2. Architect should confirm Vercel Postgres vs. Neon decision and document migration strategy for multi-tenant (per NFR17)
3. Architect should design sparkline/bullet bar SVG components or select Recharts configuration (per Story 2.2, 2.4)
4. PM to validate with pilot airline: calendar vs. fiscal quarters, confidence rollup formula preference (worst-case vs. average), unit magnitude needs (K/M/B)
