# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review the **RunwayOKR PRD** (docs/prd.md) and the **Project Brief** (docs/brief.md). Create detailed wireframes and interaction specifications for the following priority flows:

1. **CSV Import & OKR Creation Wizard (3 steps)** - Focus on drag-to-regroup UI in Step 1, auto-drafted content editing in Step 2, and Quarter/Owner selection in Step 3
2. **Dashboard with Objective Cards Grid + Risk Rail** - Specify Objective Card component layout (bullet bar, sparkline, RAG chip positioning), Risk Rail sections, and responsive behavior
3. **Check-ins Page ("My Week")** - Detail inline editing UX, keyboard navigation, batch save flow, and undo toast behavior
4. **QBR Export Layout** - Design print-ready one-pager with sections (Objective Status, Best/Worst Deltas, Stuck KRs, Notes)

Reference the **UI Design Goals** section for constraints: WCAG AA accessibility, colorblind-safe palette (Okabe-Ito), typography scale, keyboard-first interactions, optimistic UI patterns. Deliverable: Figma wireframes or annotated sketches with component specs ready for Architect to implement.

### Architect Prompt

Please review the **RunwayOKR PRD** (docs/prd.md), the **Project Brief** (docs/brief.md), and the forthcoming UX wireframes. Design the technical architecture for MVP delivery in 8-10 weeks. Prioritize:

1. **Database Schema Refinement** - Confirm Drizzle schema from Story 1.2, add indexes for performance (NFR1-4), document multi-tenant migration path (organizationId columns per NFR17)
2. **API Route Contracts** - Define request/response schemas for all endpoints (use Zod), error codes, validation rules (reference FR1-25, NFR10)
3. **Component Architecture** - Specify ObjectiveCard, KRRow, BulletBar, Sparkline, ConfidenceChip implementations (shadcn/ui + custom SVG per Technical Assumptions)
4. **State Management Strategy** - Document React Context or Zustand patterns for check-ins page, dashboard filters, wizard multi-step state
5. **Performance Strategy** - Address NFR1-4 with caching plan (sparkline data, lookups), query optimization (EXPLAIN plans), code splitting (wizard, drawer)
6. **Testing Approach** - Set up Vitest for unit/integration, document test cases for critical business logic (OKR creation, confidence rollup, CSV parsing, QBR generation)

Reference the **Technical Assumptions** section for tech stack decisions. Deliverable: Architecture document (docs/architecture.md) with diagrams, API specs, component hierarchy, and implementation guidance for stories. Flag any open questions or risks requiring PM clarification before Epic 1 begins.
