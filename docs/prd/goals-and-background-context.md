# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable airline S&M organizations to transform yearly targets into quarterly OKRs in under 5 minutes (import → first OKR created)
- Achieve 70% weekly active user rate among KR owners during the quarter (10+ weeks out of 13)
- Reduce Head of S/M status-chasing time from 4 hours/week to <30 minutes/week
- Enable weekly check-in completion in <60 seconds per KR owner
- Generate publication-ready quarterly business reviews in <5 minutes (vs. 2-3 days manual effort)
- Deliver MVP within 8-10 weeks using standalone architecture (no Slack/Teams/Jira integrations)
- Demonstrate measurable OKR value through 1 complete pilot (100-500 employee airline S&M org)

### Background Context

Airline Sales & Marketing organizations struggle with the execution gap between yearly revenue targets and quarterly results. While targets exist in spreadsheets (Direct Channel, Corporate Sales, Premium Revenue, Loyalty, Ancillary), teams lack a unified system for weekly momentum tracking. Heads of S/M spend ~4 hours/week chasing updates via email/Slack, problems surface too late (Week 10-12 of 13-week quarters), and quarterly reviews consume 2-3 days of analyst time assembling data from fragmented sources.

Generic OKR tools (Lattice, Workboard, Ally.io) require lengthy setup and integrations that create IT approval barriers for pilots. RunwayOKR solves this with a standalone web app that accepts existing CSV targets, transforms them via an intelligent wizard into 3-5 Objectives with 2-4 KRs each, maintains weekly check-ins with confidence indicators (Red/Amber/Green), and exports clean QBRs—all without dependencies on external tools. The product targets mid-to-large airlines (100-500 S&M employees) with domain-specific templates (direct channel economics, premium cabin revenue, co-brand partnerships) that provide immediate credibility and fast time-to-value.
