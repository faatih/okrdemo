# Epic 3: QBR Export & Settings Management

**Epic Goal:** Enable users to generate publication-ready quarterly business reviews in under 5 minutes and manage foundational data (teams, users, quarters, units) via Settings. This epic completes the MVP by delivering the final major value: automated QBR generation (vs. 2-3 days manual effort) and self-service administration for pilot teams.

### Story 3.1: QBR Export - One-Pager Layout

**As a** Head of Sales/Marketing,
**I want** to generate a clean one-pager quarterly review,
**so that** I can present results to the CEO without manual reformatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Reviews page (`/reviews`) with Quarter selector and "Generate QBR" button per FR15
2. API endpoint (`GET /api/reviews/:quarterId`) generates one-pager with sections: Objective Status Summary (table: Objective, Owner, Confidence, Progress %), Best Deltas (top 3 KRs with highest positive delta), Worst Deltas (top 3 KRs with highest negative delta), Stuck KRs (list KRs with no check-ins â‰¥14 days), Notes (optional textarea for user-added commentary)
3. One-pager layout uses print-friendly CSS: A4/Letter page size, clean typography (Title 20-22px, Body 15-16px per branding guidelines), margins for printing
4. QBR generation completes in <3 seconds per NFR4
5. Preview rendered in browser before export (user can review before printing/copying)
6. Notes field autosaved to `quarters` table (metadata column)

### Story 3.2: QBR Export - PDF & Markdown

**As a** Head of Sales/Marketing,
**I want** to export the QBR as PDF or Markdown,
**so that** I can share it in different formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. "Print to PDF" button triggers browser print dialog with print CSS optimized for QBR layout per FR16
2. "Copy as Markdown" button copies QBR content to clipboard in Markdown format (tables, headings, bullet lists)
3. Markdown format includes: `## Objective Status Summary`, table with pipes, `### Best Deltas`, bullet list, etc.
4. Print CSS ensures 1-2 page max (fit on A4/Letter), no page breaks mid-section
5. PDF export tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (ensure consistent output per Risk: QBR Export Quality from Brief)
6. Success toast after copy: "QBR copied to clipboard" with undo (if browser supports)
7. Fallback: if browser print not supported, show message "Please use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for PDF export"
