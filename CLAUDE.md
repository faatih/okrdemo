Core Development Philosophy
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

Design Principles
Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Single Responsibility: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
Fail Fast: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.
